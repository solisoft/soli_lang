# Introduction to Soli

Soli is a modern, statically-typed programming language designed for clarity and expressiveness. It combines object-oriented programming with functional concepts like the pipeline operator.

## Key Features

### Static Typing with Inference

Soli is statically typed, meaning type errors are caught at compile time. However, you don't always need to write types explicitly—the compiler can infer them:

```solilang
let x = 42;           // Type inferred as Int
let name = "Alice";   // Type inferred as String
let pi: Float = 3.14; // Explicit type annotation
```

### Pipeline Operator

The pipeline operator `|>` is one of Soli's most distinctive features. It lets you chain function calls in a readable, left-to-right manner:

```solilang
// Without pipeline
let result = addOne(double(5));

// With pipeline - much clearer!
let result = 5 |> double() |> addOne();
```

The left side of `|>` becomes the first argument of the function on the right.

### Object-Oriented Programming

Soli supports full OOP with classes, inheritance, and interfaces:

```solilang
interface Drawable {
    fn draw() -> String;
}

class Shape {
    x: Float;
    y: Float;

    new(x: Float, y: Float) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape implements Drawable {
    radius: Float;

    new(x: Float, y: Float, radius: Float) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    fn draw() -> String {
        return "Circle at (" + str(this.x) + ", " + str(this.y) + ")";
    }
}
```

## Design Philosophy

Soli follows these principles:

1. **Clarity over cleverness**: Code should be easy to read and understand
2. **Safety without verbosity**: Static typing shouldn't mean excessive boilerplate
3. **Familiar syntax**: Draw from popular languages to minimize learning curve
4. **Practical features**: Include features that solve real problems (like pipelines)

## Use Cases

Soli is great for:

- Learning programming concepts
- Scripting and automation
- Data transformation pipelines
- Teaching OOP and type systems
- Prototyping ideas quickly
