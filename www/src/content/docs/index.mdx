import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Pipeline Operator" icon="right-arrow">
		Transform data elegantly with `|>`. Chain function calls naturally: `5 |> double() |> addOne()`
	</Card>
	<Card title="Static Typing" icon="approve-check">
		Catch errors at compile time with type inference. Write less boilerplate, get more safety.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Object-Oriented" icon="document">
		Full OOP support with classes, inheritance, and interfaces. Build structured, maintainable code.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Pattern Matching" icon="puzzle">
		Powerful pattern matching with destructuring, guards, and nested patterns for elegant data exploration.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Modern Syntax" icon="pencil">
		Clean, readable syntax inspired by the best modern languages. Easy to learn, powerful to use.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```rust
// Define functions
fn double(x: Int) -> Int { return x * 2; }
fn addOne(x: Int) -> Int { return x + 1; }

// Use the pipeline operator
let result = 5 |> double() |> addOne();
print(result);  // Output: 11

// Pattern matching with destructuring
let user = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30};
let message = match user {
    {name: n, age: a} => n + " is " + str(a) + " years old",
    _ => "Unknown user",
};
print(message);  // Output: "Alice is 30 years old"

// Object-oriented programming
class Circle {
    radius: Float;

    new(r: Float) {
        this.radius = r;
    }

    fn area() -> Float {
        return 3.14159 * this.radius * this.radius;
    }
}

let circle = new Circle(5.0);
print(circle.area());  // Output: 78.53975
```

## Why Solilang?

Solilang combines the best ideas from modern programming languages into a cohesive, enjoyable experience:

- **Expressive**: The pipeline operator makes data transformation code read naturally
- **Safe**: Static typing catches bugs before they reach production
- **Familiar**: Syntax draws from popular languages like Rust, TypeScript, and Kotlin
- **Lightweight**: Tree-walking interpreter means fast startup and simple deployment
